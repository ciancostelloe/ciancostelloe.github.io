							<p>The Ayling’s Royal Challenge Cup (or Ayling’s Challenge Cup, its original name pre-dating royal patronage) is an annual sprint regatta taking place at Dangan slip on the 4th of August 2018.

								The event will consist of match racing in touring quads over a distance of 400m, alongside the Dangan Sports Grounds. For more information about the ARCC, read the 'About' section on our Facebook page.

								All competitors will pay a small entry fee of €10, with all profits from this year's event going towards Bone Marrow for Leukaemia Trust. Lat year over €1000 was raised. Check out the work they do here:
								<a href="https://www.facebook.com/bonemarrowtrust/">Bonemarrow Facebook page.</a>

								A bucket collection will take place for those who would like to donate but don't wish to race. For anyone who can't make it to the event but would still like to donate, you can do so by clicking on this link:
								<a href="https://www.idonate.ie/fundraiser/11371074_arcc--iii--2018.html">Fundraising campaign.</a>

								Finally, we'll have a BBQ on the day, and ARCC attire is strongly encouraged. Individual prizes will be awarded to the winning crew, along with the coveted Pamplemousse. We hope you can make it!

							<h2 class="major">History:</h2>
							<p>The regatta was first staged in 2015 and proved successful. However, due to acute onset alcoholism the following year in the organising committee, the 2016 meet was abandoned.
								At the regatta’s inception, it was intended for professional pintmen rather than those who gatted at an amateur level. At this inaugural race, competitors raced in primitive rowing boats known now as ‘coxless pairs’.
							The regatta is regarded as part of the Irish social season. As with other events in the season, the regatta has strict dress codes. For a full list of previous winners please check out our Facebook page.</p>

							<p>Here at ARCC we wanted to keep the Pamplemousse in the family. It has been passed down from generation to generation, each oarsman desperately searching for their slice of the Pineapple. 
							Special shoutout to Alex Chadfield who was awarded the spirit of the ARCC in 2017 and brought a clan of Clonmelions to Galway, one of which went on to row the boat, famously named The Big Young Fellas, with a Portora feen to become champions.</p>

							<p>The nightlife surrounding the ARCC is an absolute must! Be sure to pre-order those bottles of buckfast well in advance as every year Londis sells out. Traditionally most athletes buy the two bottles for twenty euro deal (Update 2017: Due to inflation the deal is now two for twenty two) and then have one bottle each for optimal value.
							****Due to numerous strongly worded complaints, fine wines in Spanish arch have brought back the 2 for 20 deal on buckfast</p>

								<p>Who is Keyser Bux?<br /> He is supposed to be Turkish. Some say his father was German. Nobody believed he was real. Nobody ever saw him or knew anybody that ever worked directly for him, but to hear Kobayashi tell it, anybody could have worked for Bux. You never knew. That was his power. The greatest trick the Devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist. And like that, poof. He's gone.</p>

								<p>Likes: Long walks on the beach, anything by Take That and the smell of fresh concrete in the morning.
									<br /> Dislikes: Getting pinged with pineapples. High quality beers, if it’s not Dutch it’s not clutch.

									"What's accounting but simple arithmetic?"- Mother Theresa
									The Teflon Don of treasury. If four years of Engineering has taught me anything it’s how to add or subtract numbers from other larger numbers. Why don't you do arithmetic in the boat club? Because if you’re caught adding 4 + 4 you get bate!
									Likes: Optimism while yet keeping people grounded, a work hard play hard attitude, brutal honesty, Saturday’s with the bois and of course a  phat Booj followed by Rnd II.
									Dislikes: People catching feels (JB), queue skippers, negativity, Longford and pedestrians.

									Privileged Cork boy slumming it out in the rough city of Galway. Words typically used to describe me are buoyant. Excellent parallel parker and have unmatched napping skillz. Dislike ugly things and sitting on leather couches on a sweaty day. Open to the idea of using the hashtag #yolo.

									For the ARCC this year I’ll be in charge of forgetting to provide adequate shade from the sun and supplying high quality bananas to make sure potassium levels amongst athletes are kept up to standard.

									Likes: Sick fades, cinnamon on my scrambled eggs (deal with it), €2 scratch cards. 
									Dislikes: Stopping at red lights on my bike, low quality fruit, spilling porter on my white trousers.
