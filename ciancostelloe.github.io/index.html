							<h2 class="major">Info:</h2>
							<p>The Ayling’s Royal Challenge Cup (or Ayling’s Challenge Cup, its original name pre-dating royal patronage) is an annual sprint regatta taking place at Dangan slip 
								on the 3rd of August 2019.
								The event will consist of match racing in touring quads over a distance of 400m, alongside the Dangan Sports Grounds. For more information about the ARCC 
								read the 'About' section on our Facebook page.

								All competitors will pay an entry fee of €10, with all profits from each year's event going towards Bone Marrow for Leukaemia Trust. Last year over €1000 was raised. 
								Check out the work they do here:
								<a href="https://www.facebook.com/bonemarrowtrust/">Bonemarrow Facebook page.</a>

								A bucket collection will take place for those who would like to donate but don't wish to race. For anyone who can't make it to the event but would still like to donate, 
								you can do so by clicking on this link:
								<a href="https://www.idonate.ie/fundraiser/11380800_arcc--iv--2019.html">Fundraising campaign.</a>

								Finally ARCC attire is strongly encouraged. Individual prizes will be awarded to the winning crew, along with the coveted Pamplemousse. We hope you can make it!

							<h2 class="major">History:</h2>
							<p>The regatta was first staged in 2015 and proved successful. However, due to acute onset alcoholism the following year in the organising committee, 
								the 2016 meet was abandoned.
								At the regatta’s inception, it was intended for professional pintmen rather than those who gatted at an amateur level. At this inaugural race, 
								competitors raced in primitive rowing boats known now as ‘coxless pairs’.
								The regatta is regarded as part of the Irish social season with over 200 people attending in 2018. As with other events in the season, 
								the regatta has strict dress codes. For a full list of previous winners please check out our Facebook page.</p>

							<p>Here at ARCC we wanted to keep the Pamplemousse in the family. It has been passed down from generation to generation, each oarsman desperately searching for their slice of the Pineapple. 
							Special shoutout to Alex Chadfield who was awarded the spirit of the ARCC in 2017 and brought a clan of Clonmelions to Galway, one of which went on to row the boat, famously named The Big Young Fellas, with a Portora feen to become champions.</p>

							<h2 class="major">Nightlife</h2>
							<p>The nightlife surrounding the ARCC is an absolute must! Be sure to pre-order those bottles of buckfast well in advance as every year Londis sells out. 
								Traditionally most athletes buy the two bottles for twenty euro deal (Update 2017: Due to inflation the deal is now two for twenty two) 
								and then have one bottle each for optimal value. If Eamo could stop putting holes in the ceiling of 44 for one second maybe there'll be an after sesh. I just wanna chill with the bois.
								****Due to numerous strongly worded complaints, fine wines in Spanish arch have brought back the 2 for 20 deal on buckfast (circa 2018)</p>

								<p>Who is Keyser Bux?<br /> He is supposed to be Turkish. Some say his father was German. Nobody believed he was real. Nobody ever saw him or knew anybody that ever worked directly for him, but to hear Kobayashi tell it, anybody could have worked for Bux. You never knew. That was his power. The greatest trick the Devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist. And like that, poof. He's gone.</p>

									"What's accounting but simple arithmetic?"- Mother Theresa
									The Teflon Don of treasury. If four years of Engineering has taught me anything it’s how to add or subtract numbers from other larger numbers. Why don't you do arithmetic in the boat club? Because if you’re caught adding 4 + 4 you get bate!
									Likes: Optimism while yet keeping people grounded, a work hard play hard attitude, brutal honesty, Saturday’s with the bois and of course a  phat Booj followed by Rnd II.
