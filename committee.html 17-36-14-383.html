								<h3 class="major">Joint Minister of Propaganda <br /> Keyser Bux</h3>
								<p>Who is Keyser Bux?<br /> He is supposed to be Turkish. Some say his father was German. Nobody believed he was real. Nobody ever saw him or knew anybody that ever worked directly for him, but to hear Kobayashi tell it, anybody could have worked for Bux. You never knew. That was his power. The greatest trick the Devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist. And like that, poof. He's gone.</p>

								<a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/Richie.jpg" alt="" /></a>
								<h3 class="major">Secretary <br /> Richard Bennett</h3>
								<p>Likes: Long walks on the beach, anything by Take That and the smell of fresh concrete in the morning.
									<br /> Dislikes: Getting pinged with pineapples. High quality beers, if it’s not Dutch it’s not clutch.
									2015 champ of ARCC, kings stay kings!
								</p>

								<a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/JB.jpg" alt="" /></a>
								<h3 class="major">Joint Minister of Propaganda <br />JB</h3>
								<p>Much of my life has been devoted to giving this race its rightful spot on the Mount Rushmore of sporting events. Passionate about tonic wine and spreading the good word of the ARCC. Aliases include Johnny Wasowski, Jim Beam, The Gipper, Jbooza and the White Bill Clinton.
									<br /> Facts:
									<br /> Sports guy
									<br /> Sick peripheral vision
									<br /> If Carlsberg did my haircuts they'd still be shit.
								</p>

								<a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/Will.jpg" alt="" /></a>
								<h3 class="major">Environmental Officer <br />Dr. William Finnegan</h3>
								<p>Similar to greats like Ryan Giggs, Stevie Gerrard and Gabby Agbonlahor, I’m a one club man...NUIGBC for life! My greatest achievement to date was making the semi’s at the inaugural ARCC.
								I live my life by one idiom: <br /> Maybe it's the beer talking Marge but you got a butt that won't quit. They got those big chewy pretzels here merJanthfgrr...... five dollars??!!!? get outta here...</p>

								<a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/Cian.jpg" alt="" /></a>
								<h3 class="major">Treasurer <br />Cian 'Lush King' Costelloe</h3>
								<p>
									Life moves pretty fast. If you don't stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it. Do you like Huey Lewis and the News? They expect one of us in the wreckage brother! Badman. These are just some of the things you will hear from me on the special day.
								</p>
							</article>
							<article>
								<a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/Kev.png" alt="" /></a>
								<h3 class="major">Safety/Equality Officer <br />Kev Nev</h3>
								<p>
									Privileged Cork boy slumming it out in the rough city of Galway. Words typically used to describe me are buoyant. Excellent parallel parker and have unmatched napping skillz. Dislike ugly things and sitting on leather couches on a sweaty day. Open to the idea of using the hashtag #yolo.
									Inaugural champion and one of the original founders of the mammoth sporting event that is ‘ARCC’ 
									Let’s get weird.
								</p>
							</article>
							<article>
								<a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/Nana.png" alt="" /></a>
								<h3 class="major">Gazebo Officer <br />Nana</h3>
								<p>Wait wat? <br /> 
									Men’s Intermediate 4+ champion of the world three years running.
									For the ARCC this year I’ll be in charge of forgetting to provide adequate shade from the sun and supplying high quality bananas to make sure potassium levels amongst athletes are kept up to standard.

									Likes: Sick fades, cinnamon on my scrambled eggs (deal with it), €2 scratch cards. 
									Dislikes: Stopping at red lights on my bike, low quality fruit, spilling porter on my white trousers.
								</p>

								<a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/Cliff.png" alt="" /></a>
								<h3 class="major"> Joint Minister of Propaganda/Low key Racial Diversity Officer<br />Cliff</h3>
								<p>
									You could not live with your own failure. Where did that bring you? Back to the ARCC. I thought by eliminating half of all thots, 
									the other thots would thrive. But you've shown me that's impossible and as long as there are those that remember what was, there will 
									always be those that are unable to accept what can be. They will resist.
									I know what it's like to lose. To feel so desperately that you're right but to fail nonetheless. It's frightening. Turns the legs to jelly. 
									I ask you, to what end? Dread it. Run from it. Destiny arrives all the same. And now, it's here. Or should I say, the ARCC is.
									Disclaimers Note: not afraid to pull the race card
